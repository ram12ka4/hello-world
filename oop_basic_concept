What is the difference between Function and Method ?
Ans : A function is a piece of code that is called by name. 
      It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) 
      and can optionally return data (the return value). 
      All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. 
In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:

A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class 
(remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

What is the difference beteen Formal Parameter and Actual Argument ?
Ans : Argument is often used in the sense of "actual argument" vs. "formal parameter".

The formal parameter is what's given in the function declaration/definition/prototype, 
the actual argument is what's passed when calling the function, an instance of a formal parameter, if you will.

That being said, they're often used interchangably, or depending on language/community,
and I've also heard "actual parameter" &c.

So here, x and y would be formal parameters:

int foo(int x, int y) {
    ...
}

Whereas here, in the function call, 5 and z are the actual arguments:

foo(5, z);
